# hello

My best code is not in the public domain, it belongs to my clients and employers. Occasionally, I publish libraries and snippets of hobby code here.

I have an academic background in pure mathematics, a career in quantitative finance, and solid experience in data-science and machine-learning. I hold the Canadian Securities Institute's Derivatives Market Specialist designation. I have a *penchant* for distributed architectures.
